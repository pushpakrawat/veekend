1. Venue Images on Cards
Currently, the venue cards are missing images—no photo is displayed for any listed place.

Please update the app so that each venue card reliably fetches and displays the main photo/image for the venue using the Google Places API (“photos” array from Places API).

If a photo is not available for a venue, show a clean fallback or placeholder image instead.

All displayed images must include the required Google attribution as per API guidelines.

Ensure images load quickly and do not break the card layout, even on slow networks.

2. Complete Venue Details Page
When a user clicks on a venue card, a dedicated venue detail page opens (not a modal). However, this page does not currently show all the available details about the venue fetched from the Google Places API.

Please enhance the venue details page to show:

Gallery or large view of all available photos (with attributions).

Full venue name and precise address.

Opening hours for each day and live open/close status.

Star rating, total number of ratings, and full list of recent reviews (with reviewer, rating, text, date).

Categories/types, price level, phone number, website, Google Maps link, plus code, business status (operational, temporarily closed, etc.).

Any other relevant detail (reservation link, accessibility info, etc.).

Make sure all venue data is fetched on-demand in real time from the Google Places API when a detail page is opened, and the UI shows loading states as data loads.

3. Maintain Good UX and Existing Features
Keep all other current features as they are—search, filters, login/wishlist, etc. If you can, make the categories horizontal instead of vertical.

Ensure the venue cards and detail page remain responsive, visually appealing, and accessible.

Provide clear error messages if no image or additional venue info is available.

Before starting, please confirm if you need any more API keys, Firebase/Auth credentials, or specific format preferences for the detail page or image display.

This prompt puts the focus on making venue images and details display correctly and richly, while keeping your app fast and user-friendly.
